% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
To differentiate between simple geometric shapes that can be distinguished by the number
of corners we deploy a Harris corner detector\cite{Harris88acombined} and count
the number of responses. Further, we 
investigated on the impact of various types of degenerations on the classification and ways
to preprocess the distorted images to improve classification results.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Shape recognition has been an interest in computer science since long ago. Especially in the
field of text recognition there is the well studied task of classifying scanned characters 
to construct a digital representation of a text. 
For this course however we start with a more simplistic task. Instead of having to
distinguish between a manifold of character classes, we limit ourself to 
4 simple geometric shapes (see Figure \ref{fig:tranformed_elementary_shapes}) given in monochrome and with arbitrary scale and orientation. While the original files had the 
background in in white and the shapes in black we stuck to the color encoding of black being
background and white being shape.

\caption{Shapes that can be detected through our algorithm. The scaling and orientation may be arbitrary.}
\label{fig:tranformed_elementary_shapes}
\end{figure}

\noindent
First we only considered clean images, in then extended our algorithm to also be
able to handle different kinds of degeneration. 
Specifically the effects and correction of salt-and-pepper noise, fringes and
Gaussian noise were studied in this report. 
A visualization of these degeneration types can 
be seen in Figure \ref{fig:types_noise}.

\section{Algorithm}
The key idea of our approach is to detect all corners in a given image and then assign a class according to the number of corners detected. 
For this purpose we decided to implement a Harris corner detector\cite{Harris88acombined}. 
Such a detector works well for clean images without any adaptions.
But since given images may suffer from various degenerations as mentioned before, 
a preprocessing of the input is required before applying the classification. 

In summary our algorithm does the following for each given input image:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Detect type of degeneration present in the input image.
		\item Apply corresponding preprocessing step.
		\item Detect Corners.
		\item Assign class to shape.
	\end{itemize}
	
In the following we explain in detail how every stage of our algorithm works.

\subsection{Detect Degeneration Type}
We first want to detect the type of image degeneration and then apply a customized preprocessing that directly addresses a present issue. 
Our algorithm is able to detect whether an image exhibits Gaussian noise, 
salt-and-pepper noise, fringed shape edges or has no (significant) degeneration
(See Figure \ref{fig:types_noise} for reference). 

Since our image is binary valued we can detect Gaussian noise by computing the histogram of the image. 
If it has more than two non-zero bins then we know there are other grayscale values present in the image, which is a characteristic property of Gaussian noise. 

The salt-and-pepper noise can be detected (and also corrected) by applying a median filter onto an image. 
Therefore we simply apply a median filter with window size of 5x5 pixels onto the image and compute the difference between the input image and its median filtered version. 
In case the difference is too large we assume that there is salt-and-pepper noise present. 

Finally, we need to detect jagged edges on the input (dents and bulges along edges, see Figure \ref{fig:types_noise:fringe_noise} for an example). 
Throughout this report we call this type of distortion \emph{fringes}. 
Here, we extract the difference between a clean version\footnote{Attained through applying our fringe-removal algorithm.} of the image and the fringe version. 
If the difference is too big, we suppose there are fringes present. 
	
Technically, we apply a blur-kernel onto the image. Then, we compute a mask by applying thresholding. 
Each blurred pixel value that is too small is set to zero and otherwise its value is assigned to one. 
We combine this mask with the input image by a pixel-wise operation. 
The result is a binary image with pixels equal one if the other images were one too at that pixel location and otherwise is zero. 
We count all pixels equal one and decide whether this corresponds to a fringe count \footnote{As a reminder: pixel value of 1 means that it belongs to the shape, 0 that the pixel belongs to the background}.
 
If none of the previously described checks yielded a positive result, 
we assume that the image does not suffer from any kind of degeneration.
  
\subsection{Preprocessing}
From the degeneration detection step we know what kind of issues we have to deal with. 
The simplest case occurs if no noise has been detected. 
Then our algorithm can skip this stage and thus can directly start to detect corners in the image. 

When fringes have been detected we need to restore the edges.
The idea is to smooth the edges out and then compute a new binary image by applying thresholding. 
For smoothing, we use a bilateral filter\cite{TomasiBilateralFiltering}, since we want mainly smoothing along edges, 
but not blur the edge itself. 
A more detailed motivation behind this
choice can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:bilateral_vs_gaussian_smoothed}. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]%
\centering
\subfigure[Original]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{smoothing_comparison_original}}
\subfigure[Gaussian]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{smoothing_comparison_gauss}}
\subfigure[Bilateral]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{smoothing_comparison_bilat}}
\caption{Edge restoration using different kinds of kernels. We achieved best results
using a bilateral filter. For this shape, the edge at the bottom that was distorted by 
a dent in the original was much better reconstructed by the bilateral approach.}
\label{fig:bilateral_vs_gaussian_smoothed}
\end{figure}

In case salt-and-pepper noise was detected, we have to apply a so called median filter. 
Such a filter performs a salt-and-pepper noise reduction by removing outlier peak responses in the input image. 
In detail, this is achieved by convolving the input image with a local neighborhood-window filter that sets its center value to the median of the pixels within the window. 
However, the filtered image suffers now from some kind of soft-fringes. This is why we also need to apply the edge restoration step described above. 

For Gaussian noise we assume a degradation model where noise behaves additively and follows  a normal distribution. 
Using such a noise model allows us to apply a so called Wiener-Filter\footnote{a non-linear probabilistic noise reduction}\cite{Wiener:1964:EIS:1097023} for restoration. 

\subsection{Corner Detection}
\label{sub:corner_detection}
Given a preprocessed image of a shape we want to find its corners. 
Our constraint, that each image only contains one shape, 
allows us to directly relate the number of detected corners with the type of shape we are dealing with. 

For detecting corners we rely on the so called Harris\cite{Harris88acombined} corner detector. 
We can think of it as a special kind of kernel applied to the image. 
The result is a binary image that only exhibits some small pixel blobs in locations with high response.
The design of the Harris detector leads to corners having high response while other regions mostly
are ignored. Corners can be interpreted as points having two dominant and different edge directions
within their local neighborhoods. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]%
\centering
\subfigure[Original Shape]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{square}}
\subfigure[Response]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{square_response}}\\
\subfigure[$G * I_y^2$]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{square_sx2_smoothed}}
\subfigure[$G * I_x^2$]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{square_sy2_smoothed}}
\subfigure[$G * I_xy$]{\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{square_sxy_smoothed}}
\caption{The resulting response of the Harris corner detector with the componentes
used to compute it visualized.}
\end{figure}

Edges in an image are points that depict some form of rapid change of pixel intensity.
 In other words, an edge is a series of locale maximal values. 
 A maxima corresponds to either the smallest or the largest derivative within a given domain. 
 Since either a minimum or a maximum depict a valid potential edge, we simply can compute the image gradient and take its absolute value. 
 The gradient of a 2D image is a vector field containing two components, i.e. each pixel in the image is mapped to a vector. 
 The first component is the derivative along the x-direction, the 2nd is the derivative along the y-direction. 
 We interpret the absolute value as the 2-norm in the image. 

In order to only detect strong maxima, a Harris filter also makes use of the product of the two single derivative directions. 
This can be interpreted as some kind of weighting that ensures that we only consider strong edge-intensities. 

In order to make the Harris filter more robust, one does usually have to apply a pre-smoothing onto the image. This also ensures to smooth-out small peaks in the image that would be vanish due to the taking derivative step. 

Mathematically, the Harris kernel looks like the following: 
\begin{equation}
G * 
\begin{bmatrix}
 I_y^2  & I_x I_y \\
 I_x I_y & I_x^2
\end{bmatrix}
.
\end{equation}

Where $I$ denotes the given input image and $I_x$, $I_y$ its partial derivatives, computed by a standard finite difference scheme. Furthermore, $G$ denotes a Gaussian smoothing Kernel. 

Finally, we compute the Eigenvalues of the filtered images. The largest two tell us whether we are dealing with a corner, an edge or a non-existing feature. If the two largest eigenvalues both are sufficiently large we have detected a corner.

\subsection{Shape Classification}
The classification of a shape is actually the simplest processing step. 
We count the number of detected corners from the previous step. 
There is a one to one correspondence between the number of detected corners and the shape classes
we are dealing with (See again \ref{fig:tranformed_elementary_shapes}.
However, when given a circular shape, our Harris detector does not always return zero corners. 
Thus, if we have less than 3 corners detected, we assume we found a circle. 
Similarly, for the star, we classify a shape as a star if 5 or more corners are detected.

\section{Results}

For images without noise we achieve a recognition rate of 100\%. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this work we described an algorithm capable to classify the type of a shape in a given image. For this purpose we are relying on a Harris corner detector. Thanks to an advanced preprocessing step, our classifier still works sufficiently well even if a input images suffers from issues such as noise or fringes. In conclusion, we have seen that our classifier has a detection rate of about 95 percentage. In addition we extended that it can handle images that suffer from Gaussian noise. The detection rate was similar well as for other data sets.

Currently, our classifier is limit to binary valued images. Furthermore it fails detecting corners of extremely smoothed shapes such as circles \footnote{In our corner to shape classification we assume that circles exhibit fewer than three corners} due to our corner detector algorithm.

For future work we could try to implement a probabilistic detection model that is based on machine learning. Furthermore we could try to classify arbitrary shapes such as letters for example. Another interesting idea would be to handle different types of noise distributions or combinations of image issues. Lastly, could enhance the Gaussian noise correction by assuming a different, non-linear noise degradation model.
